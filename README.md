This is my first social network, so it's not very good, but it works.

In this app, you can upload an image in the sever, this image will be available for all users, too you can open a post of the image and add a comment or delete the image, any user can be done, in the sidebar menu, you see all information of the posts in the server, as they all comment and post, the best post with more likes and latest comments.

I upload the application to Heroku and MongoDB Atlas, I shared the web link so that friends and family could upload images and works!!.

Only I have problems when the people upload images to the server, at first if the images that uploaded worked, but after days the images did not appear, causing errors on the page, for example in the statistics and post, how can you appreciate.
